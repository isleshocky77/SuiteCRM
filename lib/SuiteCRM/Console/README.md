The SuiteCRM Console
====================

SuiteCRM now implements a console through which you can execute various operations.

Usage
-----

To use any of the console commands you must first position yourself in the root folder of your SuiteCRM deployment
and execute the 'console' file through the php interpreter. 
 
On Linux, if your system is configured correctly, you can invoke the console by simply typing:
 
`./console` 
 
whilst on Windows (or if your php interpreter cannot be found automatically) you need to specify the path 
to the php interpreter and pass the name of the console file as the first argument, like: 
 
`C:\PHP\php.exe console`
 
This will launch the console application and list the available commands under 'Available commands:'.
